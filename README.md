## About

Gotham IPython is a **dark** color scheme for IPython Notebook 3 (Jupyter*ish* v3 might have different arrangement of divs, so no guarantee for v2). It is based on emacs color scheme [gotham-theme](https://github.com/wasamasa/gotham-theme) which itself is a port of the vim version [vim-gotham](https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham).
